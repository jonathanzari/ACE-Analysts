# ACE-Analysts x MHC++ Datathon x MTA
Visualizing MTA's ACE dataset to identify issues, create insights, and consider actions.

## Business Questions (To Be Answered)
## 1) Which MTA bus routes are highly utilized by CUNY students? For routes that are automated camera-enforced, how have bus speeds changed over time?

## 2) Some vehicles stopped in violation are exempt from fines due to business reasons. For vehicles that are exempt, are there repeat offenders? Where are exempt vehicles frequently in violation?

## 3) Some automated camera-enforced routes travel within or cross Manhattan's Central Business District. How have violations on these routes changed alongside the implementation of congestion pricing?
